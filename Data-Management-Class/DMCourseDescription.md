##RSM 650 - [Data Management in the Research Environment (2 credits)](https://github.com/UMiamiLibraries/courses-and-workshops/tree/master/Data-Management-Class)  

**Instructors**:  
Dr. Timothy Norris – Librarian Assistant Professor, Richter Library/Center for Computational Science  
Angela Clark – Librarian Associate Professor, RSMAS Library

**Meetings:** Monday 12-1:40pm, RSMAS

**Course Description:**  
The purpose of the course is to develop understandings of research data
in broader spatial and temporal contexts--known as the research data
lifecycle, to introduce several practical tools for digital scholarship,
and to encourage early adoption of best practices in research data
management. *The course will provide students with strategies to
increase productivity (efficiency), enable proper data stewardship
(security), and help the student exceed data management
expectations/requirements in the research environment (compliance).*
This is a practical course: students are required to produce a data
management plan for their specific research endeavor, OR to prepare and
deposit data into a discipline specific repository (other projects
subject to instructor approval will be considered). The class is open to
all graduate students in all disciplines.

**Texts and Materials:**  
There are no required texts for this course. The readings will be made available through the course website.

**Software:**  
We will use some basic open-source software packages (no license fee). You will need to install the following:  

-   Git Bash (pc only) – see:
    [*https://software-carpentry.org/v5/setup.html*](https://software-carpentry.org/v5/setup.html)[](https://software-carpentry.org/v5/setup.html)
-   Text editor (choose one) – any OS:
    [*Gedit*](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gedit); Windows:
    [*Notepad++*](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/); Mac:
    [*TextWrangler*](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/)
-   Python with [*Anaconda*](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)
-   [*R Studio*](https://www.rstudio.com/)
-   [*sqlite*](https://www.sqlite.org/) (pc only)
-   Open refine (previously google refine) -
    [*http://openrefine.org/*](http://openrefine.org/)

**Prerequisites:**   
Students should have a good idea of what their MS/PhD research will
be. If no project is identified at time of enrollment admission will
be based upon instructor approval.

**Measureable Learning Outcomes:**  
 
1.  Describe data lifecycle models and how they inform data management
    planning
2.  Identify file formats, data types, data levels and relevant software
    and understand how they inform data management and preservation.
3.  Design best practices for file system organization and file naming
    conventions to serve sound data storage, backup, and
    preservation strategies.
4.  Gain practical experience in discovering, acquiring, and
    cleaning data.
5.  Produce documentation and metadata for research data to facilitate
    discovery and re-use.
6.  Evaluate legal and ethical implications for data access and
    sharing strategies.
7.  Identify discipline specific or institutional data repositories and
    prepare data for deposit.
