**Methods of Instruction:**  
Lecture-discussion, demonstration, and practical out-of-class and
in-class assignments. Students are expected to participate in the
lectures, discussions, and in-class projects. We expect that students
have little or no prior data management experience/training, but
students with previous data management experience will also benefit from
the course.

**Evaluation of Student Performance:**  
Students will be assigned a letter grade (A-F) based on the following:

| Evaluated work | percentage / points |  
|:--- |:--- |  
| Homework Assignments | 20% / 50 pts |  
| Class Participation | 10% / 25 pts |  
| Midterm Project | 30% / 75 pts |  
| Final Project | 40% / 100 pts |  
| Total | 100% / 250 pts |  

**Assignments**  
There will be several homework assignments throughout the semester. This
will include reading and writing assignments, online tutorial
assignments, and data wrangling assignments.

**Class Participation**  
Engagement in class activities through speaking, contributing comments
to the class web-page, or participating in group projects is an
important aspect of this class

**Midterm Project**  
Create a data curation profile of your or your laboratories research.
This includes thinking through and responding to your choice of three
questions from the data curation profile toolkit (Purdue Universities,
see links in schedule below).

**Final Project**  
Create a data management plan for your research project OR
prepare/curate data for deposit into a discipline specific repository.


**Weekly Schedule:**  
All topics/dates/assignments are subject to revision/change based on
instructor decisions and any other *force majeur* that may take place
during the quarter.
