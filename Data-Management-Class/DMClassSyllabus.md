##[Data Management in the Research Environment - Syllabus](https://github.com/tibbben/school.of.data/tree/master/UM_DataManagementClass)  

**Instructors**:  
Dr. Timothy Norris – Postdoctoral Fellow Miami University Libraries  
Angela Clark – Librarian Associate Professor RSMAS Library

**2 Credits:** 600 level course

**Texts and Materials:**  
There are no required texts for this course. The readings are either
available online or will be made available through the course website.

**Software:**  
We will be using some very basic software packages all of which are
open-source (no license fee). You will need to install the following
programs on your computer.  

-   Open refine (previously google refine) -
    [*http://openrefine.org/*](http://openrefine.org/)
-   Git Bash – see:
    [*https://software-carpentry.org/v5/setup.html*](https://software-carpentry.org/v5/setup.html)[](https://software-carpentry.org/v5/setup.html)
-   Text editor (choose one) – any OS:
    [*Gedit*](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gedit); Windows:
    [*Notepad++*](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/); Mac:
    [*TextWrangler*](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/)

**Course Description:**  
The purpose of the course is to develop understandings of research data
in broader spatial and temporal contexts--known as the research data
lifecycle, to introduce several practical tools for digital scholarship,
and to encourage early adoption of best practices in research data
management. *The course will provide students with strategies to
increase productivity (efficiency), enable proper data stewardship
(security), and help the student exceed data management
expectations/requirements in the research environment (compliance).*
This is a practical course: students are required to produce a data
management plan for their specific research endeavor, OR to prepare and
deposit data into a discipline specific repository (other projects
subject to instructor approval will be considered). The class is open to
all graduate students in all disciplines.

**Prerequisites:**   
Students should have a good idea of what their MS/PhD research will
be. If no project is identified at time of enrollment admission will
be based upon instructor approval.

**Measureable Learning Outcomes:**  
 
1.  Describe data lifecycle models and how they inform data management
    planning
2.  Identify file formats, data types, data levels and relevant software
    and understand how they inform data management and preservation.
3.  Design best practices for file system organization and file naming
    conventions to serve sound data storage, backup, and
    preservation strategies.
4.  Gain practical experience in discovering, acquiring, and
    cleaning data.
5.  Produce documentation and metadata for research data to facilitate
    discovery and re-use.
6.  Evaluate legal and ethical implications for data access and
    sharing strategies.
7.  Identify discipline specific or institutional data repositories and
    prepare data for deposit.

**Methods of Instruction:**  
Lecture-discussion, demonstration, and practical out-of-class and
in-class assignments. Students are expected to participate in the
lectures, discussions, and in-class projects. We expect that students
have little or no prior data management experience/training, but
students with previous data management experience will also benefit from
the course.

**Evaluation of Student Performance:**  
Students will be assigned a letter grade (A-F) based on the following:

| Evaluated work | percentage / points |  
|:--- |:--- |  
| Homework Assignments | 20% / 50 pts |  
| Class Participation | 10% / 25 pts |  
| Midterm Project | 30% / 75 pts |  
| Final Project | 40% / 100 pts |  
| Total | 100% / 250 pts |  

**Assignments**  
There will be several homework assignments throughout the semester. This
will include reading and writing assignments, online tutorial
assignments, and data wrangling assignments.

**Class Participation**  
Engagement in class activities through speaking, contributing comments
to the class web-page, or participating in group projects is an
important aspect of this class

**Midterm Project**  
Create a data curation profile of your or your laboratories research.
This includes thinking through and responding to your choice of three
questions from the data curation profile toolkit (Purdue Universities,
see links in schedule below).

**Final Project**  
Create a data management plan for your research project OR
prepare/curate data for deposit into a discipline specific repository.


**Weekly Schedule:**  
All topics/dates/assignments are subject to revision/change based on
instructor decisions and any other *force majeur* that may take place
during the quarter.
