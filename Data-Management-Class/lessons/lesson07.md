**Lesson Plan**
  
*__Class 1__*  

1. Review readings (5 minutes)
2. File System Organization (lecture 15 minutes) 
  - Folders
  - Files
    - come up with list of benefits. Think finding, sharing, backup, sorting, versions, migration
3. Pair/Share activity - my file system (15 minutes)
  - Do one of the two
    - Design your files system for data capture (go to at least three levels)
    - critique your current file system on your computer (what is could and what could be better)
4. Introduce Versioning
  - subversion (apache)
  - git (linux)
5. Introduce Batch Naming
  - need to rename many files or folders (often from sensors)
  - pre-packaged tools or command line
    - really a pre-packaged tool is a collection of command line tools 
6. Introduce BASH
  - live coding teaching environment
  - run through first shell novice lesson on Software carpentry
    - [*http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/*](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/)
    - print the first few lessons and use as much as there is time for - go slow - have fun
7. Introduce extra readings and homework #2

*__Class 2__*  

1. Check in on homework
2. Continue with Software Carpentry shell novice lesson (see above)
