**Lesson Plan**
  
*__Class 1__*  

1. Houskeeping (5 minutes)
  - check in on progress, mention howework #2 will be assigned on wednesday
  - mention that on Wednesday we will go over midterm assignement and tentative workflow calendar
2. Open Data (20 minutes)
  - really get them to think (perhaps outloud) aout what "open" means to them in terms of:
    - Open access, open data, open source, open content, open knowledge
	- social movement with many sides (not all who speak to open data agree on what it is or why we do it)
    - speak to data vs database
    - speak to open source, community source, proprietary (costs, who pays)
    - is open source a new economic model? many people belive so (as we transition to an information economy)
    - open linked data???
  - Data Governance on the lifecycle
    - pretty much everywhere in the lifecycle diagram, but not so much in the collection phase
    - always will be tensions (there is never a simple solution)
  - definitions
    - open data
    - open data characteristics (ideal vs. .gov) [from Kitchin]
	- key words: share-alike, attribution
	- not that there is no "one" definition
	- Larry Lessig: Harvard Law Professor and internet activist; thought leader on licensing and copyright; actually was a nominee for democratic presidential candidate 2016 (but withdrew)
	- linked open data (LOD) is an extension of open data; next big thing? We will return to this at end of class.
  - Review: why and why not (research context)
    - overview of benefits and diffuculties
    - then a brief discussion of attampts to seek solutions (perhaps with emphasis on library context)
	- note that this class is a part of the solution
    - all disciplines different!!
  - broader context (why and why not)
    - note that transparency should be in research context as well (taxes paid for research)
    - story of GPS receivers, 1984 satellite signals made "open," now we see a proliferation of businesses that benefitted
    - think also about remotely sensed data (high investment, but incredibly useful for MANY things)
    - lots of volunteer work in the open data movement, who benefits?
	- %LIKE% is an example of SQL syntax
	- lots of discussion about how data (open or not) empowers some and dis-empowers others, particularly the "Digital Divide"
	- "Digital Divide" is know to be growing currently, not lessening. Particularly in the context of global "North/South" relations, but also in "developed" countries like the US (inner city dwellers do not have the same access to digital tools, information, and education on how to use it)
    - mention that Facebook sells data to governments across to globe at a high price (identify terrorists)
3. Software Licensing and Open Source Software (20 minutes)
  - take a moment and have them write down several things - discuss
    - what they think open source software is
    - who uses open source software
    - where you might find open source software (kinds of devices)
  - define - note similarities between open source and open data
    - they should know: Richard Stallman - independent lawyer and internet activist - "invented" the open source license (GNU)
	- they should know: Linus Torvalds - inventor of linux: reverse engineered UNIX and released for no cost under Stallman's license
    - open data drew from older open source community
  - talk about licensing
    - tell tale of GNU and Richard Stallman
      - free software foundation and drafting of GNU license
      - free, not as in free beer but as in free speech
    - GNU slightly more restrictive on redistribution must remain open (than BSD) - a form of "copyleft" (all derivatives must retain the same distribution license)
    - BSD - Berkeley Software Distribution (lots of innovation at the Berkeley computing facilites released under this license)
    - MIT perhaps most permissive, you can do anything but the license must remain with the distribute/modifie copy
    - Apache - probably most restrictive, can still remain patented
  - examples of Open Source Software
    - linux
      - flavors (Ubuntu, CentOS, and Fedora fairly popular, but there are hundreds)
      - paid for "enterprise support" services (support, updates, etc.), but the code comes at no cost
    - apache
      - pretty much runs the internet in conjunction with linux
	  - linux runs the system and apache runs the server software 
    - other honorable mentions
	  - open office (SUN mirosystems)
	  - GIMP (Photoshop clone)
	  - QGIS (GIS)
	  - wordpress (UM uses wordpress for many departmental sites including libraries)
	  - MySQL and PHP is a backbone for dynamic web pages (commercial web sites)
4. University of Miami Policy (20 minutes)
  - Introduce the Data Policy article - place UM on the tables (approx)
    - UM $309 Million in grants 2014-15
    - UM has approx. 3000 faculty
  - University Ownership (from Faculty Manual)
    - all research products (data included explicitly, there is work going on in office of research and in Library to make better policy)
    - software is not an exception
  - Faculty Manual (on Data)
    - a little on hiring and promotion
    - mostly about misconduct and investigations into misconduct
  - Graduate Student Manual (on Data)
    - all about misconduct
