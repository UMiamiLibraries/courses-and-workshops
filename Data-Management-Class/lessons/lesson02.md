**Lesson Plan**

*__Class 1__*  

0. Housekeeping (5 minutes)  
1. Review and expand upon data life cycle (lecture 5 minutes)
  - Research Data Lifecycle and Data Curation Lifecycle (latter as part of former)
  - note that data curation/management is a hot topic currently  
2. Reflect for a moment: how is your research funded? What Data Management requirements do you have? (write it down - 2 minutes. If you don't have any, think of your career goals)  
3. Review readings (discussion/lecture 15 minutes)
  - Any words starting to jump out as common themes? (metadata, repositories, stored indefinately, accessible, disciplinary practice, intellectual property, security [privacy],interoperability, embargo, ontologies, schemas)
    - see if they can make list on board
    - divide into two groups (maybe?) and have them come up with definitions for these keywords (guided discussion)
  - Book chapter "Promoting the Stewardship of Research Data
    - largely a review of what was discussed last week
    - major themes: data loss, disciplinary practice, save or toss, ownership
    - point out IPCSR and ESA initiatives - discuss briefly
    - problem areas: standards, ownership, sustainability (financial)
    - if there is time, discuss recommendations
  - OMB 2013 Memorandum
    - see slides - go over policy requirements in detail, define terms witrh the class (machine readable, data standards, open licenses, common core metadata)
    - who pays, how much and for how long?
  - SHOW NCEI website as a response to both memos (mostly first) and GIDEP (since 1950s)
  - discuss value: over time, of different data (obervational, modeled, experimental)
4. Review open data briefly and use to introduce the Data Management Plan (lecture 15 minutes)
  - five basic components (but vary between agencies, private foundations, and so on)
  - these components inform some of the upcoming class topics
    - Data types and formats (next class)
      - sensors? ownership of inputs? observational? experimental? and so on
      - two data types: structures (tables, trees, triples) and levels (raw, processed, analyzed, published)
      - software needed in process steps, workflows, algorithms
      - file formats, naming conventions and organization
      - backup strategies, security, version control
      - who is responsible
      - quality assurance
    - Metadata
      - machine vs. human readable (formats)
      - standards (often discipline specific)
    - Policies for Access and Sharing
    - Plans for archiving and preservation
      - no really, best to think of this before research (like target journals for publicatons)
    - Budget
  - show the DMPtool and the library of plans (5 minutes)
    - login and explore a little
    - emphasize that these are NOT vetted for quality 
  - forget about carrots and sticks (class participation - 5 minutes - perhaps??)
    - find our how many students have written a non-funded grant proposal, try to pair those with with those without
      - make two lists, benefits and problems of writing the grant proposal that is not funded
      - make the lists in front of the class with their input
      - if it doesn't appear on the benefit list - make sure they see the value of thinking through a project - planning, writing, revision
5. Data Management Plans Assignment check in (10 minutes)
  - Pair - what did you find in your selected DMP (5 minutes)
    - strengths and weaknesses
    - anything unexpected
  - Share (5 minutes)
6. Introduce next weeks readings and installation of text editor (5 mintues)

-   If your research lab has an existing DMP bring it to class

> Assignment \#1: 

- write a one-page evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of a DMP (can be from your research lab)
