  - Prepare data for deposit.
  - Cite deposited data correctly

---

**Lesson Plan**
  
*__Class 1__*  

1. Houskeeping (5 minutes)
  - note homework 4 graded, homework 5 assigned later today
  - last two weeks to hopefully bring things back together
    - we will review several things today and then focus on repositories and data citation
2. Preservation vs backup
  - lots of library experience here (preservation), thought of as step in storage, archiving, preserving, curating
  - think about time, how data is chainging through time
  - preservation or conservation? does it matter?
3. archving data (a recipe)
  - appraisal 
    - very human process based on guestimates
    - British archives quote from DCC
    - also part of curation?
	- roles and responsibilities also from DCC
	- why is Europe so involved in this? - have them think for a moment
	  - what other institutions have appraisal processes?
	  - use example of DMP archive?
	- TAKEHOME: best to make part of workflow, know what you will throw away/keep and do not mix
  - checksum review
    - remind people that all digital data is fragile, we cannot trust storage
	- all computer code has checksums (why?)
	- look for them on open source software packages, once aware you will see them everywhere
  - format review
    - remind them that this is at both ends: DMP and archival process
	- it is common to have different formats for working and archiving
	- remind them to pay attention to character encoding - once again, it is everywhere
  - repositories
    - READING REVIEW: data sharing
	  - adverse use
	  - academic data is not a commons
	  - strong policy environment to promote sharing
	  - who funds the research???
	- location selection
	  - none of these are set in stone
	- online repositories
	  - run by university, company, grant driven organization - HYBRIDITY
	  - some are long-term, some not so: be aware
	  - there are many: directories are sometimes hard to navigate -> ask adviser??? ask librarian??? ask peer???
	  - note RSMAS faculty use BCO-DMO, NSIDC, others (ask them what they know)
4. data citation
  - tracking!! downloads, use, career booster??? (carrot)
  - DOI review - permanent resource locator
    - permanent???
	- role of resolving service (commercial venture)
	- mentione internic (internet domain name registration services), icann (internet corporation for assigned names and numbers)
  - suggest they get an orcid

*__Class 2__*  

1. Checking and Housekeeping
  - show the example of the MD5 checksum from the KNB respository
2. Introduction to SQL
  - first part as intro from Software Carpentry Lesson [*http://swcarpentry.github.io/sql-novice-survey/*](http://swcarpentry.github.io/sql-novice-survey/)
  - table, spreadsheet, database
  - database vs database manager
    - oracle, IBM, posgreSQL, mySQL, SQLite, Access
	- database can be moved between managers fairly easily (.csv)
  - relational database (use example from [*http://swcarpentry.github.io/sql-novice-survey/01-select.html*](http://swcarpentry.github.io/sql-novice-survey/01-select.html))
    - primary keys and foreign keys (terms and relationships: one to one, many to one, one to many)
	- normalization of data (removing duplicate entries)
  - introduction to SQL
    - SELECT FROM
	- SELECT FROM ORDER BY
	- SELECT FROM WHERE
	- SELECT FROM JOIN
3. Introduction to Access
4. reminder about semantic web reading
