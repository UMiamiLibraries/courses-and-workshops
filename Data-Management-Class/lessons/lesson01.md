**Lesson Plan**  

*__Class 1__*  

1. Introductions  
  - Instructors (10 min)  
  - Course objective and outline (lecture 15 min)  
2. What is data  
  - introduction (5 min)  
  - pair and share activity (5 min pair/20 min share)  
3. Why Manage Data: Data Management and Data Sharing (lecture 15 min)  
  - introduction to readings  

*__Class 2__*  

1. Why Manage Data: Data Management and Data Sharing (cont. 10 minutes max)  
  - Data [Sharing Snafu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2zK3sAtr-4) in 3 short acts
  - up to slide 10 is review (use as appropriate for conversation and time)
2. Review readings (10-15 minutes)
  - slides 11-14 have some perhaps useful material for the review of readings  
  - Holdren
    - Clearly he is for the promotion of data sharing - are there implications for the environment? (his background)
    - implications for other fields? biotechnology, engineering, computer science, physics? Take some time to think about other fields: security, privacy, human subjects, inventions, and so on
    - are there other fields allied to the environment that would suppport open data?
    - are there certain fields that would be opposed to open data?
    - emphasize that the memo is targeted at federal agencies (mostly), and also federally funded research at universities
    - article versus data
  - NSF
    - data management plans - compliance vs really managing data better
    - article vs. data?
    - ownership questions (for later in course, but bring them up now) (data versus IP)
    - note the nod to disciplinary differences
    - costs of sharing data are part of grant (how to estimate?)
    - small versus big data?
3. arguments for and against data sharing; really thinking through the 'open data' debate (15 minutes max)
  - split class in two groups: one group for data sharing, one against (this can also be done together)
  - 10 minutes to brainstorm arguments
  - 5 minutes to present arguments (style as debate if there are enough students)  
4. Revisit arguments as lecture (10-15 minutes) (slides 15-20 have some good material for talking to open data)
  - fill in any gaps from debate
  - much of this material wil be covered in later classes, but good to introduce here
  - the for and against arguments rely heavily on the Kitchin (2014) book (chapter 3)
6. Introduction to week two readings (10 minutes)
  - slides 21-29 have material to introduce 'Data Management Planning' and the readings for next week
