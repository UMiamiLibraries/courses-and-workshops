**Lesson Plan**
  
*__Class 1__*  

1. Houskeeping (5 minutes)
  - check in on progress, identify problems, attemt to resolve
  - ask about the word curation, what does it mean to them
  - check for vegetarians in the room!!! apologize in advance.
  - check in on the creative commons license - do they recognize it? We will cover later after break.
2. Introduction to the Data Curation Profiles (lecture 25 minutes)
  - Curation: we have been talking so far, what is the curation of data??
    - use the data curation slide set to start a conversation on both the human and technical aspects
    - emphasize that it is really a human process (deciding on values and then dedicating time and resources based on those values)
    - mention/seek similarities with DMPs
  - The original idea: emphasize that this is anthropology
    - the "other"
    - semi-structured interviews and grounded theory (anthro methodology)
    - produces a thick description
    - for information professionals in academia (read librarians) [no disrespect, but comment on rigid format]
  - The data story: 
    - this is social science (perhaps expand why this is important - context of all science)
    - emphasize listening as a research skill
    - remind them of "primary data" - the data being produced by that person
  - BREAK - moving into more specific details on components and approaches 
  - Sections
    - too much to do (or even useful perhaps - what is purpose, values?)
    - immediately cut out topics we have not covered
    - extra notes:
      - tools includes software
      - data management is backup, storage and security
      - personnel is who is responsible in lab setting
    - note that really it is all about sharing, why and how (or why not)
      - interoperability and discovery are a big part of this, interesting conversation, but we have not covered in class yet
  - The preparation is extremely important
    - you will be more confident
    - you will be able to put the answers to your questions into a meaningful context
    - if there is a lull in the conversation/interview, you will have questions to ask
  - The Interview
    - I do not expect you to be an expert social scientist, but to make your best effort (life skill)
    - emphasize the importance of the question
      - only one questin at a time
      - leading questions
      - very serious in social science - the "instrument" of measure
    - recording - NO - they should make their own interview guide 
      - can be mine or the one from the DCP toolkit
      - they should modify it to have just what they need - PRINTED OUT
      - type notes into computer - at least on the same day if not right after the interview
  - Two examples
    - the data worksheet (pretty self-explanatory)
    - the connection between the original question - the follow up question - the notes - the written statement
      - likely that we will not use a questionaire (not recomended for this class)
      - but follow the connection through the question, followup question, and written description
3. The UM library experience (Angela 20 minutes)
4. Discussion (20 minutes)
  - get them to focus on their particular adaptations
  - perhaps get them to test questions on the instructors, themselves

*__Class 2__*  

1. Housekeeping (5 minutes)
  - make sure they are all on track, if not request meetings outside of class
2. Quick overview of my experience with interviews at UM (10 minutes, perhaps a little more)
3. Class presentations of the DCP of choice (20 minutes)
4. Introduce metadata and 'reading' for next class
  - have them choose one reading fro the list - discuss - we can look for more if none are satisfactory
  - make sure also to remind people about software carpentry
5. Introduction to git (software carpentry - rest of class)
