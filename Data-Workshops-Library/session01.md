**Preparation Before the Seminar**  

_Seek a call for grant applications in your discipline(s) and identify the requirements for articulating a data management plan. The big three funding agency pages are a good place to start:_

* The [NSF funding page](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/) (policies vary by direcotrate)
* The [NIH funding page](https://grants.nih.gov/funding/index.htm) (policy can be found [here](http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/data_sharing/index.htm))
* The [NEH grant opportunities page](https://www.neh.gov/grants) (sharing guidelines can be found [here](http://www.neh.gov/files/grants/data_management_plans_2015.pdf))

_Find a DMP and read it before coming to the seminar_

* Use a DMP provided by a professor or student in your discipline if available (_best option_)  
* Choose a DMP to from https://dmptool.org/public_dmps. 
    - NOTE: “They are not vetted for quality, completeness, or adherence to funder guidelines.”
    - This collection is mostly comprised of data management plans for the NSF, _but there are several from the NEH and other independent agencies as well._
* Visit the NIH website to see their collection of public DMPs.
    - a few short examples can be found [here](http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/data_sharing/data_sharing_guidance.htm#ex)
* Visit the NEH website to see their collection of publiuc DMPs. You can also identify their data management and data sharing requirements.  
    - The in 2015 the NEH [announced](https://www.neh.gov/divisions/odh/grant-news/data-management-plans-successful-grant-applications-2011-2014-now-available) a collection of publicly available DMP plans that can be found [here](http://www.neh.gov/files/dmp_from_successful_grants.zip). 
    - These plans are based on these [Data Management Plans guidelines](http://www.neh.gov/files/grants/data_management_plans_2015.pdf) publishied by the NEH in 2015.
* There are several other collections available as well
    - [ICPSR Data Management Plan Resources and Examples](http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/content/datamanagement/dmp/resources.html) (social science)
    - [DataONE DMP samples](https://www.dataone.org/data-management-planning) (earth and biological science)
    - [The IDCC collection of sample DMPS](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/data-management-plans/guidance-examples) (a curated set of links to many disciplines)
    - [University of Arizona DMP Examples](http://data.library.arizona.edu/data-management-plans/data-management-plan-examples) (for their research community)
    - [UCSD’s collection of sample NSF DMPs](http://libraries.ucsd.edu/services/data-curation/data-management/dmp-samples.html) (from their research community)

**Suggested Reading:**  

-   [Research Lifecycle](http://library.ucf.edu/about/departments/scholarly-communication/research-lifecycle/). University of Central Florida. _One of the best elaborated data life cycle diagrams._
-   The White House, Office of the President (2013). Open Data Policy—Managing Information as an Asset. [https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2013/m-13-13.pdf](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2013/m-13-13.pdf). _Federal open data policy._
-   Committee on Ensuring the Utility and Integrity of Research Data in a Digital Age (2009). “Promoting the Stewardship of Research Data” (Chap 4) in *Ensuring the Integrity, Accessibility, and Stewardship of Research Data in the Digital Age*. National Academies Press, Washington D.C. [http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12615/ensuring-the-integrity-accessibility-and-stewardship-of-research-data-in-the-digital-age](http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12615/ensuring-the-integrity-accessibility-and-stewardship-of-research-data-in-the-digital-age). _The entire book is an excellent read and chapter four is a good starting point to think about data curation in the research setting (incentives, hows and whys, common problems, and so on)._
-   [The DART Project: using data management plans as a research tool](https://osf.io/qh6ad/). Amanda Whitmire, Jacob Carlson, Brian Westra, Patricia Hswe, and Susan Parham. _A set of tools including a rubric to assess DMP quality and completeness. We will go over this in detail during the seminar._
